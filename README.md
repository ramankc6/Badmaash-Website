# Badmaash-Website
For technical round of Snap Engineering Academy

## Developer Log
### Day 1
I just got the prompt and I am really excited! Firstly I needed to find a business in LA. For this I choose a retaurant called Badmaash. 
It’s a Canadian-Panjabi fusion place owned by a family of Indian immigrants. The reason I picked it is cause it’s a success story of POC immigrants moving to the US and finding success and as a first gen immigrant that was really inspiring.
