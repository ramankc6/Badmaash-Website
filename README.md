# Badmaash-Website
For technical round of Snap Engineering Academy

## Developer Log
### Day 1
I just got the prompt and I am really excited! Firstly I needed to find a business in LA. For this I choose a retaurant called Badmaash. 
It’s a Canadian-Panjabi fusion place owned by a family of Indian immigrants. The reason I picked it is cause it’s a success story of POC immigrants moving to the US and finding success and as a first gen immigrant that was really inspiring.\
\
I started by making a planning board. There were a list of features that were requires and a list of features that were optional. We were adviced to pick 3 from the optional list. Since I wanted to really challenge myself as a developer during this project and show off what I can do, I decided to try to impliment every since optional feature. I also made a list of technologies that I would need to use to complete the project. I decided to use Svelte as my framework because that is what I am most familiar with.\

This is what the planning board looked like:\

### Day 2

I want split this project into 3 parts. Design, Code and Test. Today was the first design day. I started by contacting the owners of the restaurant to understand the "vibe" that the restaurant has. I got a chance to talk to the owner and he told me that the restaurant is very causal but also very classy. He also told me that the restaurant is very family friendly and that they have a lot of kids that come in. He also told me about the history behind the restaurant and gruelling journey of taking a risk and gambling on yourself to achive the American dream. I was genuinely really touched by this and was more excited than ever to get started on this project!\
\
I realized that my biggest weakness was design since I am color blind and I have a hard time picking out colors that look good together. I decided to use a color palette generator to help me with this. I found a really good one called [Coolors](https://colorhunt.co/). I also decided to create the design on Figma before developing it so that I could keep my code base organized.\
\
My first itteration was admittedly really bad. No matter what, I was not able to make it look very visually apealing. I then decided to first put my focus on funtionality and then go back and make it look better. This allowed me to make more steady progress.\
\
This is what it looked like after the first itteration:\

This is what it looked like after I went back and make it look better:\

I think what really helped me was creating a Pinterest board of websites that I liked and then using that as a reference. I also used a lot of the design principles that I learned from watching YouTube videos.\
\
I can't want to start coding tomorrow!\
